# About

This is a simple project we'll be working through on a workshop, and then iterating changes into through ongoing assignments.

# Commit One - Fundamentals of HTML

Going from bare files to actually seeing something in the browser.

* What does HTML need.

  * Doctype
  * head

    * title
    * meta viewport and charset tags<sup>[1](#f1)</sup>

  * body

* Why is this important? (The browser does work without it, but you suffer from a lot of 'undefined behaviour' quirks.)

## Footnotes

<sup name="f1" id="f1">1</sup> Not technically required by the html spec, as the others are, but very important in the same way.
